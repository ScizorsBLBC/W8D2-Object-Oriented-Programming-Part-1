# Bank Account Management System

This is a simple bank account management system implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows you to create bank accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, check balances, and view account information.

## Files

* `main.py`: The main program that runs the bank account system.
* `classes.py`: Contains the `BankAccount` class that defines the structure and behavior of bank accounts.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` and `classes.py` files are located.
4. Run the program by typing `python3 main.py` (or `python main.py` if your default Python version is 3) and pressing Enter. (Your exact python command may differ if you are using Windows, Linux, or a different dev environment setup than I am on my Macbook.)

## Interacting with Bank Accounts

The program will create two bank accounts for Bob and Alice. You will see their initial account information. Then, the program will automatically perform some transactions (deposits and withdrawals) and show the updated information.

## Additional Notes

* The `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account details and provides methods for managing transactions.
* The `main.py` file demonstrates how to create instances of the `BankAccount` class and use its methods.

**Accreditation Notes:**

- I worked on this assignment with my breakout room group of Bryan Garret & Darien Davis.

- I used Google Gemini Advanced to help me debug some of the traceback calls that I could not solve using online resources in addition to the course materials such as Stack Overflow, and to help me with the details for this readme file and the documentation.

- I use Stack Overflow & W3 Schools as a resource in most of my coding, mostly to help understand what is happening in the terminal errors when I cannot find the information in the course materials.
